**An in-depth guide to becoming proficient in spatial data analysis using QGIS 3.4 and 3.6 with Python**

## What is this book about?
QGIS is an open source solution to GIS and widely used by GIS professionals all over the world. It is the leading alternative to proprietary GIS software. Although QGIS is described as intuitive, it is also, by default, complex. Knowing which tools to use and how to apply them is essential to producing valuable deliverables on time.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create and manage a spatial database 
* Get to know advanced techniques to style GIS data 
* Prepare both vector and raster data for processing 
* Add heat maps, live layer effects, and labels to your maps 
* Master LAStools and GRASS integration with the Processing Toolbox 
* Edit and repair topological data errors 
* Automate workflows with batch processing and the QGIS Graphical Modeler 
* Integrate Python scripting into your data processing workflows 
* Develop your own QGIS plugins

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
SELECT distname as road_name, roadnumber, geom FROM SU_Road WHERE classifica LIKE 'A Road%' AND roadnumber = 'A25'
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a GIS professional, a consultant, a student, or perhaps a fast learner who wants to go beyond the basics of QGIS, then this book is for you. It will prepare you to realize the full potential of QGIS.
