  Description:
    Abstract:
      This map layer is an Arc/INFO grid map of land cover characteristics for 
      North America, excluding Hawaii, and including the Caribbean and most of 
      Mexico.  The nominal spatial resolution is 1 km and the map layer is 
      based on 1-km AVHRR data.  The data were compiled by staff at the National 
      Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science as part of the Global 
      Land Cover Characterization Project.  The land cover classes were produced 
      using 1-km AVHRR data from April 1992 to March 1993.  Documentation and 
      the original data are available at <http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/glcc/>.  
      The data available through the National Atlas of the United States are in 
      GeoTIFF format.  This is a revised version of the May 2002 map layer, with 
      a corrected shoreline for Greenland.

    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      continental level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. 
      No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of
      these data.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The following table describes the display of land cover characteristics 
      classes in the TIFF image:

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 
        The Land Cover image was downloaded from the EROS site 
        <http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/glcc/glcc_version1.html#NorthAmerica>.
        A header file was created from the information provided in the North 
        America Documentation file located at 
        <http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/glcc/nadoc1_2.html>
        The header file consisted of the following parameters:
        >nrows 8996
        >ncols 9223
        >nbands 1
        >nbits 8

        >ydim 1000.0
        >ulxmap -4487000.0
        >ulymap 4480000.0  
        The data were converted from image format to ESRI GRID format using 
        the command IMAGEGRID.  The file was then reprojected to change the
        latitude of projection center from 50 degress to 45 degrees.  A
        shoreline mask was created using the file shorelp020l.  It was used to 
        add land areas not included in the Land Cover map, including some 
        Aleutian islands, Hawaii, eastern Russia, Iceland, and half of 
        Greenland.  These land areas were given a code of 255.  The image was 
        truncated to cover the same area as shorelp020l, and the resulting 
        file was converted to TIFF format using the RGB colors listed in the
        Supplemental_Information section.

        A GeoTIFF Revision 1.0 header was added and PackBits compression was

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Image data for Greenland were adjusted and remasked to correct for 
        geometric distortion in the northwest part of the island between the 
        Robeson Channel and Cape Morris Jesup, and to improve registration with 
        a new, corrected coastline derived from World Vector Shoreline (WVS). 

        A link coverage was created in ArcEdit containing links between the 
        original Greenland data and the new coastline.  The link coverage was 
        used in the Arc Adjust command to perform a linear transformation with 
        nearest neighbor resampling on the original image, stored as an Arc/INFO 
        grid dataset.  The resulting image is geometrically correct and fits the 
        WVS coastline.  This correction was applied to data for Greenland only; 
        the rest of the image was left unchanged.
